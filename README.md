# Travel Tracker

Travel Tracker is an app that tracks a user's previous travels. Each user can input locations they have been and the date for that location. A user can add, update, and delete any trips, and has access to all trip information for their login.

## Planning
I followed General Assembly's suggested schedule. I first started with the back end. I made my model for my travel information. I then created routes for each action needed which are: create, index/show, update, delete. I created curl scripts to test these actions, and then added ownership to the user to ensure that a user could not make changes to someone else's inputs. I then worked on front end (please refer to front-end repo linked above for more detailed information), and then deployed both front and back end.

## Unsolved Problems
I would like to find a better color scheme for the whole web page itself, and style it better. For future versions I would like to have a title for each travel and also experiences for those travels. I have a lot of stretch goals for this project for future versions.
